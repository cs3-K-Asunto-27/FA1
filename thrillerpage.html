			 <h1> Thriller was Jackson's sixth studio album. It blended pop, rock, dance, and funk, and allowed Jackson to explore darker themes like paranoia and the supernatural. In a 2007 interview with Ebony magazine, Jackson said, “I wanted to make an album where every song was a killer.”Overall, I list Thriller as the greatest of all time because of its diversity in music style, the wonderful production, the timeless quality that makes it recognizable across all generations, and its status as the highest selling album. </h1>
