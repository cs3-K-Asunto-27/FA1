			 <h1> Jackson and Quincy Jones were masters of album construction, so “Bad” mellows from hard funk on the title track to the softness of “Man in the Mirror” and “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You,” and eventually grows into the hard rock of “Dirty Diana” and “Smooth Criminal.” The varied instrumentation helps express the darker, more mature facets of Michael Jackson: The seductive funk showcases his lust, while the heavier guitars and louder drums expresses a rage and frustration with the world around him. </h1>
